# Advent of Code

[**Advent of Code**](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels made by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

This repository contains solutions of the Advent of Code puzzles, written in *Ruby*. They're not perfect and I'm well aware about that) But anyway, if you need them, you can use them. If you want do puzzles yourself, please go to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) website. There are many puzzles to solve!
